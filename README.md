# InteractiveHandTracker

Project to use handtracking software to make webpages interactive. Initially only one hand to be recognised and interacted with due to the limits on cursors. Hand motion acts as a cursor to interact with certain DOM objects. Increasing complexity of animations and even gesture recognitions to be explored.

The main handtracking software comes from Victor Dibia (HandTrack: A Library For Prototyping Real-time Hand TrackingInterfaces using Convolutional Neural Networks, https://github.com/victordibia/handtracking) while the animations were produced with the help of the anime.js API.
